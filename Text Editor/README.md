// This was my final academic project for my intro to C++ class. My
// professor, Alex Thornton, gave us about a third of the modules. It
// was my job to understand what he had written already, inherit
// from whatever classes I needed to, and build new code to create the
// full text editor. It still took an incredible amount of hours to work
// perfectly, and with no memory leaks, but I'm extremely happy with how
// it turned out. I left some of the comments that professor Thornton wrote
// so it would help tie a few of these files together and
// even give him a bit of credit for the code he wrote himself.

This is a C++ Based text editor that supports the following commands/interations:
  * Normal typing (Type any key and it'll appear on the text editor)
  * Move cursor right (Ctrl + L)
  * Move cursor left (Ctrl + J)
  * Move cursor up (Ctrl + I)
  * Move cursor down (Ctrl + K)
  * Backspace (Ctrl + O)
  * Create new line (Ctrl + N)
  * Delete line (Ctrl + B)
  * Cursor Home (Ctrl + H)
  * Cursor End (Ctrl + U)
  * Undo (Ctrl + Z)
  * Redo (Ctrl + Y)
  * Quit (Ctrl + Q)

Note: The tarball file that I included in the text editor folder contains the same three folders: app, exp, and gtest.
