## The Project
For this project, I utilized a stock API to extract data about a company specified by user.
The user would specify from four different buy/sell strategies.
Based on the strategy they picked, I printed out a chart indicating whether they should've bought or sold the stock on a given day.

## What I would do for the future
I would use HTML to implement a web-based version of my program and make the chart look more user-friendly.

## This is a what a chart looks like for the stock of the company Boohoo.com (BOO)
### (The chart prints out the stock data for the past user-specified number of days, which in this case is 10)

### Note:
Unforunately, I lost my credentials for the API, so my program can no longer compile/run.
