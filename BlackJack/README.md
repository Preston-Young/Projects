### This is a text-based version of the popular Casino game BlackJack, which was coded in Python.
By doing extensive research, I made sure to stay faithful to everything about the game, from the payout for a BlackJack to the side bets, such as Insurance.
I took information from many different websites to create a version of BlackJack with the most standard rules.
The website of rules I referred the most to can be found here: https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/

### What I liked about this project
I enjoyed this project a lot because it helped me practice making clean, commented code that was well-separated into their respective classes and accounted for user error.
Although I coded this in Python, I borrowed my knowledge and techniques from C++ and Java
by adding parameter and return types to all my methods and utilizing private const variables.

### What I want to implement in the future
In the near future, I plan to launch an online version using a remote server.
I plan to use Python's socket library to handle the a client/server communication for the project.

### Here's a sample interaction of the game
